       		Liar's Dice is a game of who can survive the longest by bidding, passing, and bluffing.  The goal of the game is to be the last player with dice.  The game is played in rounds consisting of increasing bids.  Each round ends with one player losing a die (except in one special circumstance, an exact).  Each player's dice are concealed from the other players under a cup.

        <p>
            Each player starts with five dice in their "hand."  The game will randomly select a player to play first in the first round.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Each round, each player's dice will be rerolled.  The round begins with the starting player making a bid or taking some other action.  Play continues as players make bids or other actions in turn.  The round ends when a player challenges another player's bid or pass, or when a player exacts the last bid.  Play continues each round until only one player has dice remaining, at which point that player is declared the winner.

        <p>
            <b>Bid</b>: A claim that there is at least a certain number of dice of a given face (Alice bids 5 6s).  Bids must be higher than the previous bid (higher count, higher face, or both).  Ones, except during special rules, always count towards the face of the current bid.  Ones are "wildcards" in other words.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because ones contribute to the counts of all other dice, there are special rules for bidding ones during non-special rules.  You can increase a bid by bidding at least N/2 ones, rounding up as necessary, where N is the count of the current bid.  You can also bid following a one bid by either increasing the one bid or doubling the number of ones plus one, N * 2 + 1.
        </p>
        <p>Going to Ones: roundup(N/2)</p>
        <p>Going from Ones: N * 2 + 1</p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Pass</b>: A claim that all the player's dice are the same face (ones are not wild for passes).
        </p>

        <p>
        	<b>Push</b>: In a bid or pass, a player may also push dice.  In game, this is accomplished by tapping on your dice.  A player may push no more than all of their dice but one.  During a push, the pushed dice are revealed to all players and the player's dice are rerolled.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Exact</b>: A claim that the previous bid is exactly accurate, no more or less dice than the bid claims. The player wins a die if they are correct and have less than five dice, but loses a die if incorrect. You can only make one exact per game.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <b>Challenge</b>: A claim that the previous bid or pass is invalid. In a bid this means that there are less dice than claimed.  In a pass this means that all the dice are not the same face.  The loser in the challenge loses a die. A player can challenge a bid or pass through a single prior pass (except when there are only two players).
        </p>
        
        <h3>
            <center>Special Rules</center>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            In games with more than two players remaining, the first time a player is down to one die, ones are not wild in the next round of play and only players with one die can change the face of the bid.  Therefore, one bids are treated like any other bid and the special minimum count rules do not apply.
